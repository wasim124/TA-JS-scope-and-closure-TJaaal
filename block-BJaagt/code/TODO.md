Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = "Arya";
}
console.log(useranme); // useranme is not defined
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `username`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`.

2. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
{
  const username = "Arya";
}
console.log(useranme); // useranme is not defined
```

there is no `username` in global scope.username define in block and it can't access that' why code throw an error

3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  let username = "Arya";
}
console.log(username); // useranme is not defined
```

there is no `username` in global scope. that' why code throw an error.username defined inside `if`

4. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  var username = "Arya";
}
console.log(username); //arya
```

there is no `username` in global scope. that' why code throw an error.username defined inside `if`

5. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = "John";
if (true) {
  var username = "Arya";
}
console.log(username); // username already declared
```

6. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = "John";
if (true) {
  let username = "Arya";
}
console.log(username); // Jhon
```

7. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = "John";
function sayHello() {
  let username = "Arya";
}
sayHello();
console.log(username); // jhon
```

8. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, "First"); // 0 First to 9 first
}
console.log(i, "Second"); // 10 second
```

9. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, "First"); // 0 First to 9 first
}
console.log(i, "Second"); // i is not defined --because it search i outside of loop
```
